# Welcome to the Menu FOREX mockup application

Purpose of this application is for testing, it is only meant for non-commercial usage.

It is a simple application for exchanging US dollars for one of the pre-configured foreign currencies.
Back-end API is built using Laravel 11 (PHP/MySQL), while front-end is a simple Vue.JS mini application used for showcasing back-end
functionalities.

Application is packed inside a single repository for more comfortable and easier setup.
In reality, back-end and front-end would be separate repositories.

### Setup process

- Clone repository using command: `git clone https://github.com/vLA-D/menu_forex.git`
- Change working directory to newly created one: `cd menu_forex`

Follow both directories' readme instructions in order to properly setup the project.

### Folder structure:
