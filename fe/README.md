# Menu FOREX front-end


Simple frontend connector to Menu FOREX API backend, built using VueJS JavaScript framework (loaded via CDN)
and Bootstrap styling framework.

In reality, this would be its own repository with proper AuthN and AuthZ implementation, using fully-fledged JS framework.
It does not require any setup, after properly setting up back-end you only need to run `index.html` file.
